<h3>About Me</h3>
<hr>
<p class="text-center">
     I am a student of Bener Cordan Middle School. I am currently studying in the seventh year. <br> <br>
     Even though I wasn't accepted to science and art centers during primary school,
     I realized my passion for coding only in the 5th grade. I have been dealing with software for about 2 to 3 years and I will continue to do so...
